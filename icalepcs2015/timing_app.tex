\begin{abstract}
   RAON is a particle accelerator to research the interaction between the nucleus forming a rare isotope as Korean heavy-ion accelerator. RAON accelerator consists of a number of facilities and equipments as a large-scaled experimental device operating under the distributed environment. For synchronization control between these experimental devices, timing system of the RAON uses the VME-based EVG/EVR system. This paper is intended to test high-speed device control with timing event signal. To test the high-speed performance of the control logic with the minimized event signal delay, we are planing to establish the step motor controller testbed applying the FPGA chip. The testbed controller will be configured with Zynq 7000 series of Xilinx FPGA chip. Zynq as SoC (System on Chip) is divided into PS (Processing System) with PL (Programmable Logic). PS with the dual-core ARM cpu is performing the high-level control logic at run-time on linux operating system. PL with the low-level FPGA I/O signal interfaces with the step motor controller directly with the event signal received from timing system.
   
   This paper describes the content and performance evaluation obtaining from the step motor control through the various synchronized event signal received from the timing system.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
The RAON is a new heavy ion accelerator under construction in South Korea, which is to produce a variety of stable ion and rare isotope beams to support various researches for the basic science and applied research applications\cite{TSHOO:NIMB}. To produce the isotopes to fulfill the requirements we have planed the several modes of operation scheme which require fine-tuned synchronous controls, asynchronous controls, or both among the accelerator complexes. RAON, which is a large experimental facility, consists of many experimental devices and additional facilities. For synchronized control under the distributed environment, timing system of the RAON uses the VME-based EVG/EVR system.

\section{Timing System}
The timing system uses the Event Generator(EVG)/Event Receiver (EVR)\cite{mrf} system of the Micro-Research Finland Oy company and VME form factor. The timing system consists of an EVG which converts timing events and signals to an optical signal distributed through Fan-Out units to an array of EVRs. The EVRs decode the optical signal and produce hardware and software output signals based on the timing events. The VME controller installed in VME crate uses MVME6100 or 3100 of Emerson company. The VME controllers use real-time operating system, VxWorks 6.9 for a fast response. Those controllers control FPGA-based EVG/EVR boards using mfrioc2 of EPICS IOCs on VxWorks.

	\label{timing:rack}
\end{figure}

Referring to the configuration of Fig.~\ref{timing:rack}, GPS receiver synchronizes with rubidium clock and EVG to 1PPS. Signal generator generates RAON reference clock(81.25 MHz, RF master oscillator) to EVG. The two signals of EVG are synchronized by locking the phase.

\section{Fast Stepper Motor Testbed using timing signal}
Configuration of Fig.~\ref{stepper} shows the overall of a fast stepper motor testbed operating by the input of the timing signal. The EVG of the timing system receives two input signals, SRS rubidium clock and RF reference clock. The two signals of EVG are synchronized by locking phase. EPICS software module, mrfioc2, on real-time OS (vxWorks) of VME controller registers event codes. The synchronized events of EVG are distributed through optical fiber links to EVGs.The EVRs received some events from EVG decode those events and trigger TTL level signals to ZC706 evaluation board. The PL of zynq which is received from external TTL signal triggers signal to motor controller according to the configured motor's operation parameters. The setting of the parameter values for the motor control is performed on the EPICS interface of the zynq PS. PS is equipped with the EPICS software module on the cross-compiled linux OS of the ARM processor. The interface between PS and PL uses the AXI interface of AMBA. The ARM Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA)\cite{amba-bus} is an open-standard, on-chip interconnect specification for the connection and management of functional blocks in system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. It should be also developed the linux device driver for the AXI interface between both area. The types of motor which can be supported to low voltage drive board of the Analog Device\cite{analog} are brushless DC, PMSM, brushed DC or stepper motor. 

\subsection{System on Chip: FPGA - Zynq}
Zynq\cite{xilix,zynq} as SoC is divided into Processing System (PS,dual-core ARM cpu) with  Programmable Logic (PL, FPGA). Communication between PS and PL is through the AXI interface of ABMA.

\subsection{ZC706 Evaluation Board of Xilinx}
The ZC706 evaluation board for All Programmable SoC (AP SoC) provides a hardware environment for developing and evaluating designs targeting the ZynqÂ®-7000 AP SoC.\cite{zc706-doc} The ZC706 board has the SMA port which is the programmable user clock for the TTL out signal of the EVR timing board.

\subsection{Controller for Motor Drive}
Fig.\ref{controller} shows the controller and low voltage drive board of the Analog Devices to drive the motor. Controller board communicates with ZC706 via FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC) connector. FMC connector of the controller board is connected to XADC interface, digital I/O and sensors, two gigabit ethernet modules, power line and so on. XADC and digital I/O signals among those connections are delivered to the low voltage drive board via the drive board connector. The low voltage drive board received those signals generates Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal through the MOSFET gate driver and drives the stepper motor. The low voltage drive board is supplied 12${\sim}$24V DC power from the external power source.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Linux on Zynq PS (ARM processor)}
To operate linux OS on the ARM processor of the zynq PS there consists of:
\begin{Itemize}
	\item ARM Cross Compile Tool Chain (arm-linux-gnueabihf)
	\item Linux Kernel Source (Linaro)
	\item Bootloader (BOOT.BIN)
	\item Board Support Package (Linux Device Tree)
	\item Root File System (Busybox)
\end{Itemize}

\begin{figure*}[!tbh]
	\centering
	\includegraphics*[width=\textwidth,height=0.7\textwidth]{motor-testbed}
	\caption{Fast motor testbed adopted zynq device using timing event signal}
	\label{stepper}
\end{figure*}

Linaro is a not-for-profit engineering organization that works on free and open-source software such as the Linux kernel, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), power management, graphics and multimedia interfaces for the ARM family of instruction sets and implementations thereof as well as for the Heterogeneous System Architecture\cite{linaro}.   
The linaro kernel source is the ubuntu-based kernel source including a lot of device driver such as zynq device tree.
The bootloader of PS uses u-boot\cite{u-boot} supporting for the zynq device of Xilinx. To boot the zynq device, it should be made up the boot.bin file created by vivado\cite{vivado} tool. The boot.bin\cite{boot-bin} file consists of fsbl.elf (First Stage BootLoader), u-boot.elf (Second BootLoader), uImage (kernel zImage for uboot ), zynq.bif (Boot Image Format file) and user.bit (bitstream file of FPGA). The linux kernel is using the root file system generated by the busybox\cite{busybox} tool.

\subsection{Linux Device Driver}
Linux device driver for zynq PS uses Industrial IO (IIO) module of the Analog Devices. Libiio\cite{iio} is a library that has been developed by Analog Devices to ease the development of software interfacing Linux Industrial I/O (IIO) devices. Localbackend module of Fig.~\ref{stepper} through the system call goes into kernel mode and accesses the iio device driver via "struct file\_operations". Basically the iio device driver implemented with the charater device type.

\subsection{Software Interface}

\subsubsection{EPICS IOC} 
is being implemented using the libiio library that abstracted the low-level details of the hardware, as shown Fig.~\ref{stepper}. EPICS is a set of open source software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes and other large scientific experiments\cite{epics}.
The device support routine of EPICS is implemented using the libiio library to read or write the parameter values for the motor control. The motor control parameters become the Process Variables (PVs) of EPICS and are carried out the EPICS database processing according to EPICS scan rate. Also, it is going to develop additional EPICS waveform PV to monitor the PWM signal of the low voltage drive board.

\subsubsection{FPGA Interface}
reuses the Hardware Description Lanaguage (HDL) code which is provided by the Analog Devices when to buy the controller board. FPGA HDL code is develeped by VerilogHDL using Vivado of Xilinx. When the motor controller was purchased from Analog Devices, it operated on ZedBoard. It should be changed to operate the ZC706 board as well as ZedBoard. It is going to transplant the code of ZedBoard into ZC706 board. In addition, It is being implementing FPGA code to drive the motor receiving the input signals via user clock port from the EVR of the timing system on ZC706 board.

\section{Conclusion}
Timing system can distribute the fine synchronized event signal at a high speed. The objective of the stepper motor control testbed is to know how to operate the timing system and apply to the high speed controller. The overall implementation is still underway, however if the distributed control system using EPICS makes a connection with the high speed parallel processing of FPGA, it is possible to improve the performance and efficiency. Zynq SoC can be considered as an ideal device to implement this part.
